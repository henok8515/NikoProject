          Welding is a process used to join metal parts by producing a
          coalescence, called a weld, at a joint. Advances in welding technology
          have opened the way for innovative designs in structures and
          machinery. Of modern welding processes, the greatest number fall under
          the general classifications of arc welding, gas welding and cutting,
          resistance welding, and brazing. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding is
          one of the arc welding methods. This method is suitable for many kinds
          of metals, but especially for welding of stainless steels, aluminum
          and magnesium. In stainless steel industry, TIG welding has an
          important role on joining thin sheets, tubes and pipes. Depending on
          this important role, the mechanical behaviours of TIG welded
          joints…show more content… An inert shielding gas is used in the
          process at no applied pressure. Argon is most commonly used as the
          shielding gas, and the process may be employed with or without the
          addition of filler metal. Helium, carbon dioxide and hydrogen (mixed
          with argon) are other main examples of shielding gases for TIG
          welding. TIG is widely used for thinner sections. It's extremely
          suited to join thin sheets, tubes and making root pass welding in
          pipes, since the heat input in this process is minimal.{" "}
